# Collatz-Conjecture

Testing if a specific number abides the Collatz Conjecture (3x+1)

The Collatz Conjecture states that if any number follows the algoritm under, it will always shrink down to one.

Algorithm:
If the number is even, divide it by 2
If the number is odd, multiply the number by 3 and add 1 to the result
